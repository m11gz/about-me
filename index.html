    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <main>
      I'm Miguel Rodriguez. I was born in Orange, CA. For people that don't know
      it's a city right next to Disneyland. I was raised in a city called
      Corona, CA. A suburb with nothing too special about it. It was a nice and
      quiet place to have been raised. outside of work. Specifically about the
      brain and body connection. As well as cutting edge research on psylocbin
      treatment. It's always been an interest to me growing up. Research
      indicates that it can help with brain neuroplasticity, memory, dementia,
      IQ scores, PTSD, and depression. Just to be clear I am not a doctor so do
      not take any advice from this page. I am not liable for any misuse that
      may have occured. Conduct your own research. My end goal in life is to
      help people. I want to change the world. With this career in programming I
      wish to work with a company that can do that. It would be amazing to work
      with a science company although it would probaby be hard seeing as how I
      do not have the credentials for anything science related. However a man
      can wish and try. Below is my favorite scientist. Dr. Andrew Huberman.
